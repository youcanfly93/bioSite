                My boyfriend, Andrew was born in Riverside California in 1986. He is the only son, born to Robert and Valerie, who immigrated to the United States from the Philippines in 1977. He grew up in Moreno Valley, California with his two sisters, Roselyn and Lia. Upon completion of high school, he was accepted to the University of California, Berkeley. After graduating with honors, he went on to attend the University of Southern California where he received his Juris Doctor in 2012. He then became an attorney for the United States Department of Veteran Affairs, where he successfully litigated the defense of many cases.
                Currently, Andrew is also serving as an appointed official on the City of Mission Viejoâ€™s Planning and Transportation Commission. This position allows him to serve the public, by working with planners and citizens on various city improvement projects. He also is politically active in his community, informing everyone around him about various issues and how to be involved.
                In his free time, Andrew loves to take spontaneous trips to the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, California. He also enjoys watching movies and going out to eat at restaurants. He has six nieces and nephews that he loves very dearly. He spends his time with them by visiting their sports games, taking them out to ice cream, and helping them in school.
                Andrew plans on using his litigation experience to fight against oppressive or discriminatory practices. He hopes to one day become an elected official, possibly as the States Attorney or United States House of Representatives Member. Until then, he is grateful for the incredible experiences he is receiving from his current position.
